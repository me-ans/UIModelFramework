## Experimental UI Framework

### A proof-of-concept for a declarative UI framework based on generated code

Declarative UI frameworks are often based on XML, JSON or other representations, with concepts leaning on current web technology, like CSS, responsiveness and scripting. This experimental architecture is meant as a proof-of-concept for a possible alternative that uses generated C++ code instead. It is based on the Juce library.

There's a short whitepaper of sorts in the Docs folder.

### Status

The proposed architecture is experimental, incomplete and buggy. Since it turned out to be less optimal than expected for the originally intended purpose, it can no longer be pursued with priority. It is unclear if and when I might find the time to eventually complete this in my spare time.
